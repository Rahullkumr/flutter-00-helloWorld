## Why Dart was selected for Flutter?

- Smooth transition animations at 60 fps (best for game dev)
- Automatically does Garbage Collection
- Compilation and Execution in Dart:
  - uses JIT and AOT compilation
  - JIT used during development (Hot Reload) and AOT (during release build) which compiles Dart code to Native machine code
- HOT RELOAD 
  - uses JIT compilation and builds the app within a second
- Easy syntax similar to c++ and java

```diff
- Almost all Modern programming languages can do these, what's special about Dart?

+ It's capability to transpile dart code that can target different architectures(runtimes) and hardwares
+ including x86(Desktop/laptops), ARM (Mobile devices) to even JavaScript Engines(Browsers)
```
- ARM = Advanced RISC(Reduced Instruction Set Computing) Machine
